Needs a config.js in src/dbHandlers looking like this:
```
const dbConfig = {
    host: 'localhost'
    user: 'Username'
    password: 'Password',
    database: 'name of the db'
    port: 3306
};
````

Many queries aren't connected at the moment, because I only worked with parts of it so far. Will be changed if I ever use it for the history of another chain.
Try to make sense out of starter.js or ask me directly.
